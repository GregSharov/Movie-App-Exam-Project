Home Cinema
Welcome to Home Cinema, a student project developed as part of my Full Stack development studies at Ashkelon Academic College. This application allows users to manage a collection of movies by adding, deleting, and searching through them based on various criteria.

About the Project
Home Cinema is a web application that simulates a basic movie library. Although it's in test mode (no actual video playback, just images), it provides a functional interface for managing movie data. Users can add new movies, delete existing ones, and search for movies by title, director, year, or actors.

Technologies Used
This project was built using the following technologies:

Node.js: Server-side JavaScript runtime environment.
Express.js: Web application framework for Node.js.
EJS: Embedded JavaScript templating engine for rendering dynamic content.
Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for styling the application.
jQuery: JavaScript library for DOM manipulation and event handling.
JavaScript: Core programming language used throughout the application.
Local JSON File: Used as the database to store movie information.
GitHub: Version control and collaboration platform.

Features
Add New Movies: Users can add new movies to the collection by providing information like title, director, year, and actors. In this test mode, movies are represented by images instead of actual video files.

Delete Movies: Movies can be removed from the collection with a simple delete function.

Search Movies: Users can search for movies by various criteria, including title, director, year, and actors.
